# Project Reallite

## Instructions - Superquadrics Parsing
Build environment:
* Linux (latest Ubuntu works)
* Python3
* Every package in the requirements.txt

Same instructions as directory-level README except now everything is with Python3.
    e.g: Installing PyQt4 should be done with the instruction: ` sudo apt-get install python3-pyqt4`
